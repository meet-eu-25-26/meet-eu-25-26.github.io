# ðŸ§¬ Computational Biology Project â€“ Identification of Inhibitors of SLC6A20 (SIT1)

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Overview
This course challenges students to **develop a complete computational biology project**, addressing an **open and ambitious biological question**.  
The central theme this year is:

> **Identification of putative inhibitors for the SLC6A20 transporter (SIT1) and characterization of the molecular determinants of its specificity.**

Students will integrate **structural bioinformatics, data analysis, and automation** to discover small molecules that selectively inhibit SLC6A20.

## ðŸ§  Biological Context

### The Biological Problem
**SLC6A20 (SIT1)** is a membrane transporter that moves **glycine and proline** across cell membranes.  
It belongs to the **SLC6 family**, which includes neurotransmitter transporters (GAT, SERT, DAT, etc.) and amino acid transporters.  

SLC6A20 is clinically relevant because:
- It is a **therapeutic target for diabetes**  
- It is an **emerging target in COVID-19 research**

Understanding how it recognizes its substrates and how its function can be inhibited has important biomedical implications.

## ðŸ§© The SLC6 Family and LeuT Fold

SLC6 transporters adopt the **LeuT fold**, with 12 transmembrane helices organized into:
- **Static domain**  
- **Mobile domain** enabling transport through conformational changes  

During the transport cycle, the protein alternates between:
- **Outward-open**  
- **Occluded**  
- **Inward-open**  

Several **3D structures of SLC6A20 and its homolog SLC6A19** are available and will guide your analysis.

## ðŸ§¬ SLC6A20 (SIT1) â€“ Key Information

| Conformation | Ligand | PDB | Description |
|--------------|---------|-----|------------|
| Occluded | Proline (substrate) | 8I91 | SLC6A20 bound to its natural substrate |
| Inward-Open | Tiagabine (inhibitor) | 8WM3 | SLC6A20 bound to a known inhibitor |
| Outward-Open | Model | SIT1_Model_OO | Homology model based on SLC6A19 |

## ðŸ§ª Course Objectives

Design and implement a **pipeline** that:

1. Analyzes the **sequence and/or structure** of SLC6A20 and homologs.  
2. Identifies and characterizes **binding sites** (orthosteric and/or allosteric).  
3. Evaluates **residue specificity** among SLC6 homologs.  
4. Screens a set of **small molecules** to identify potential inhibitors.  
5. Produces a **ranked list of inhibitors** based on interaction and specificity scores.  

> The entire process must be **automated, reproducible, and well-documented**.
